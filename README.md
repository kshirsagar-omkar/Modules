# Web Integration Modules (Java Servlet + JSP)

This repository contains a collection of small, test-ready modules built using Java Servlets and JSP for exploring and integrating various backend features.

Each module is self-contained and focuses on implementing one functionality at a time â€” such as authentication, payments, email sending, file uploads, and more.

These modules are ideal for:

- Feature integration testing
- Learning backend concepts in Java
- Rapid prototyping of web features
- Reusable backend code samples

This project is intended for students, developers, or anyone experimenting with Java web technologies in a modular way.
